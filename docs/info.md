## How it works

Aiming to create 2 ring oscillators at around 600MHz and 300MHz. The output will be quite attenuated due to the pad.

* Ring oscillator 1 is made of 18 inverters and a NAND gate for enable. 
* Ring oscillator 2 is made of 36 inverters and a NAND gate for enable. 

To get a good output current, a 2 stage inverter is used with large drive transistors.

* [Ring oscillator 1](https://xschem-viewer.com/?file=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmattvenn%2Ftt08-analog-ring-osc%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fxschem%2Fring.sch)
* [Ring oscillator 2](https://xschem-viewer.com/?file=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmattvenn%2Ftt08-analog-ring-osc%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fxschem%2Fring_2.sch)
* [Driver](https://xschem-viewer.com/?file=https://github.com/mattvenn/tt08-analog-ring-osc/blob/main/xschem/driver.sch)

The output waveform of the 600MHz is expected to be as shown in the cyan trace (out_parax). The ring_out_parax and pre_drive_parax are internal signals. See the xschem test bench for more details.

## How to test

* Enable 600 MHz oscillator 1 by setting user input pin 0 high and measure the signal at analog output 0.
* Enable 300 MHz oscillator 2 by setting user input pin 1 high and measure the signal at analog output 1.

The 300 MHz ring oscillator had a problem with a missing contact in TT08, and is not expected to work. It has been fixed for TT09.

## External hardware

Oscilloscope.
